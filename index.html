      <h1>Catriece Gilbert</h1>
      <p>Hi! My name is Catriece! I am 27 years old and am a newbie to the coding world. I graduated from the University of Kentucky with a degree in Elementary Education. I would love to one day merge the two passions that I have in Education and Web Development, creating an app that is proven and helpful to students and the growing literacy gap. My other hobbies include singing! I love to sing and to write music for my local church as well as the masses. I am a married woman with one baby boy and another on the way. So grateful for the life God has granted me to live! </p>

        I looked down at the board. "The <strong>point</strong> isn't to win?" I asked. "The
        <strong>point</strong>," <span>Bredon</span> said grandly, "is to <u>play</u> a <em>beautiful</em> game." He lifted
        his hands and shrugged, his face breaking into a beautific smile. "Why
        would I want to win anything other than a <em>beautiful</em> game?"
